# INVENTORY-MANAGEMENT
Interned at DRDL in Inventory Management, enhancing inventory accuracy and streamlining processes. Handled data entry, analyzed stock trends, and supported supply chain operations—sharpening analytical skills, attention to detail, and inventory control knowledge.
# 🗂️ Inventory Management System – DRDL Internship

A desktop-based inventory management solution developed during my internship at **Defense Research & Development Laboratory (DRDL)**. This system improves inventory accuracy, tracks equipment, and automates shelf life and disposal monitoring.
## 📌 Background

Manual inventory handling often leads to inefficiencies, data loss, and time delays. This system was built to address these issues by digitizing inventory workflows, reducing errors, and improving traceability of stock movement within the lab environment.
## 🧠 Project Overview

This Java Swing application integrates with MySQL to provide a complete inventory management experience. It includes modules for equipment management, disposal records, shelf life tracking, and user authentication — all via a user-friendly graphical interface.
## 🚀 Key Features

- ✅ Secure login and user management  
- ✅ Add, edit, and delete equipment records  
- ✅ Monitor item shelf life and flag expired items  
- ✅ Record and manage disposed equipment  
- ✅ Visual and interactive GUI using Java Swing  
- ✅ Database-driven structure with SQL schema  
## 🛠️ Technologies Used

| Component   | Technology         |
|-------------|--------------------|
| Language    | Java               |
| GUI         | Java Swing         |
| Database    | MySQL              |
| Build Tool  | Apache Ant         |
## 🧩 Major Modules

- `Login.java`: Handles user authentication  
- `Home.java`: Serves as the main dashboard  
- `Equipments.java`: CRUD operations on equipment  
- `DisposalRecord.java`: Track removed assets  
- `ShelfLife.java`: Manages shelf life & expiration 
## 🗄️ Database Structure

- `inventory_usertable.sql` – User credentials  
- `inventory_equipmenttable.sql` – Item details  
- `inventory_inventorytable.sql` – Stock tracking  
- `inventory_divisiontable.sql` – Department mapping  
## 🔧 How to Run

1. Import project into NetBeans or IntelliJ  
2. Set up MySQL and run `.sql` files to create tables  
3. Update database credentials in code  
4. Compile using `build.xml`  
5. Run `InventoryManagementSystem.java`
## 🎯 Outcome

This project helped me understand the real-world application of software in inventory control. I gained hands-on experience in Java development, SQL database design, and GUI-based software architecture.
